# PersonalLegendMeteorJS
Personal Legend is an interesting part of my development history, and a project that I never thought would be â€˜public.â€™ Until today this project sat dormant in a private BitBucket repo. 

Itâ€™s been about a year and a half since I last looked at the code, and itâ€™s been an interesting exercise going back and reviewing it. While I cringe at some of the code, Iâ€™m also very proud of how much I learned while working on this project. Whether it was design/UI experiments, learning the ropes with Meteor, or just trying out different tricks Iâ€™d learned with JS as a whole, this project is where Iâ€™d invest most of my free time for the better part of a year.

I recently attended a really great talk on open-source. At one point the speakers discussed the advantages of sharing your code publically, and how it made them stronger developers. I think over the first few years of my programming career, I was very self-conscious of my abilities as a programmer, and was really nervous of sharing code (especially experimental code) which may have made me look â€˜less-thanâ€™ in the eyes of my peers. However, in the spirit of transparency, Iâ€™m happy to open this code up as a sign of where Iâ€™ve been in the earlier stages of my career, and perhaps how far Iâ€™ve come.

This project will likely not run as is (.ENV file missing and all that), but if youâ€™re ever curious about some of the decisions I made on this project, feel free to hit me up and Iâ€™ll try my best to remember where and/or why certain decisions were made ðŸ˜‚
